If the function is 
K(uh) instead of K(u/h), the effect on the standard deviation is different.

Horizontal scaling for K(uh):
In K(uh), multiplying the input 
u by h compresses the function horizontally. The larger the value of h, the more compressed the function becomes.

Impact on standard deviation:
When you scale the input by h, the standard deviation scales inversely. 

So, if the original standard deviation of K(u) is σK, the standard deviation of K(uh) becomes σK/h.
This happens because the function's spread decreases as h increases, and the standard deviation, which measures the spread, becomes smaller.

Summary:
For K(uh), the standard deviation becomes σK/h, meaning it decreases as h increases. 
This is the opposite of K(u/h), where the standard deviation increases as h increases.
