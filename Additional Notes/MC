EFFICIENCY
Given two estimates theta_1 & theta_2, theta_1 is more efficient if var(theta_1) < var(theta_2)

Importance sampling is an extension of the principle of Monte Carlo simulations. It consists in choosing an adequate
sampling distribution (from which random realizations are generated) in order to approximate the expected value with
“good” control on the estimation variance.
