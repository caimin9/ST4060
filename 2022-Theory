2022 Q1): Based on the above results, briefly discuss whether S could be thought to follow a Poisson
binomial distribution with E(S) = ∑5i=1 pi = 5p and Var(S) = ∑5i=1(1−pi)pi = 5p(1−p).

2022 Q2):Briefly discuss whether the normal approximation is a reasonable approach for calculation
of the confidence interval for the p-value of the correlation test.

2022 Q3)
e) Based on (c) and (d), briefly discuss which model better describes the residuals, and what this tells you about your GLM fit obtained in (a)
g) Briefly discuss whether you would use the GLM fit from (a) or the B-spline from (f) to analyse the data (x,y), using relevant output to support your opinion.

2022Q4)
